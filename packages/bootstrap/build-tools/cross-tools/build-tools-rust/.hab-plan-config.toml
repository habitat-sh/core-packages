# The following dependencies are needed at runtime by Cargo for the associated reasons:
# 1. core/cacerts - Provides SSL certificates necessary for secure connections.
# 2. core/binutils - Supplies the 'ld' linker, utilized indirectly by Rust through gcc.
# 3. core/tzdata - Needed for the proper operation of the GNU C Library (glibc).
# 4. core/iana-etc - Also required for the functioning of glibc.
