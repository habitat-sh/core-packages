# Most host system linkers utilize the LD_RUN_PATH environment variable to set 
# the runpath for linked binaries. This is a standard practice and can be 
# disregarded safely. The hab-plan-build script automatically includes the current 
# package's lib directory (if present) in the LD_RUN_PATH variable. 
# It's important to note that this behavior is distinct from the ld-wrapper.sh script 
# used with binutils linkers in later stages. The ld-wrapper.sh script only adds an 
# entry if a necessary library is located within the folder and is also part of the LD_RUN_PATH.
