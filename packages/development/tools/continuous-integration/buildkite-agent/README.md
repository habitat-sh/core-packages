# buildkite-agent

The buildkite-agent is a small, reliable, and cross-platform build runner that makes it easy to run automated builds on your own infrastructure. Itâ€™s main responsibilities are polling [buildkite.com](https://buildkite.com) for work, running build jobs, reporting back the status code and output log of the job, and uploading the job's artifacts.

Full documentation is available at [buildkite.com/docs/agent](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent).
